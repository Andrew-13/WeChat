# WeChat
WeChat Desktop for Windows in Russian
----

### "Installation process"
1. Before replacing the file, you need to log out of your WeChat account and close the program.

2. Place the downloaded [**WeChatResource.dll**][1] file into the WeChat installation folder on your computer. By default, this folder is located in this path: **`C:\Program Files (x86)\Tencent\WeChat`**

###### If you installed WeChat in a different folder, then just place this [**WeChatResource.dll**][1] file in the folder where WeChat was installed on your computer.

### Advice
- In order to avoid the loss of the Russian language, it is probably better to turn off the automatic WeChat update in the setting. Only after you have made sure that I have added the file with the Russian language to the new version of WeChat, you can manually update WeChat and replace the **WeChatResource.dll** file.
- It is better to save the original file **WeChatResource.dll** somewhere beforehand, so that if some kind of failure occurs in WeChat or the program does not want to start, then it will be possible to return the original file to its original location.

###### After all, a file that has been wildly modified is not immune from failures and errors.
