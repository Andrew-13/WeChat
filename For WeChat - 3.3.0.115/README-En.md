# WeChat - 3.3.0.115
WeChat Desktop for Windows in Russian

"Installation process"
1. Before replacing the file, you need to log out of your WeChat account and close the program.

2. Place the downloaded "WeChatResource.dll" file into the WeChat installation folder on your computer. By default, this folder is located in this path: C: \ Program Files (x86) \ Tencent \ WeChat
(If you installed WeChat in a different folder, then just place this "WeChatResource.dll" file in the folder where WeChat was installed on your computer.)

Advice:
It is better to save the original file "WeChatResource.dll" somewhere beforehand, so that if some kind of failure occurs in WeChat or the program does not want to start, then it will be possible to return the original file to its original location.
(After all, a file that has been wildly modified is not immune from failures and errors.)
